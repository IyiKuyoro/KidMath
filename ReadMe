This is a math operations game intended for children. 
It was created as part of my attempt to better understand how some advanced classes work and are implemented. I wish to sincerely apologise for any lack of elegance in the code, I take full responsibility. I sometimes encountered errors that I found difficult to solve and just had to find a quick work around. 
Please accept the code as it is as I continue to develop my skills.


The original idea for the game is not mine, but the entire you UI design and feel was concieved by myself.
